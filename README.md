offline-resources
=================

Repository collecting cached versions of online resources.

It includes a Gradle build that is configured with downloading, packaging and publishing online resources for offline use in different contexts.

Currently the actual resources are not added to the repository, though this may change at a later point if we think it makes sense.

The goal is to use this as a base for using these resources for offline use in different applications, e.g. hale studio, deegree, etc.
