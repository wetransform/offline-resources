description: |
   Retrieve only part of the data by slicing or trimming along one or more axis
   For trimming: {axisAbbrev}({low}:{high}) (preserves dimensionality)
   For slicing:  {axisAbbrev}({value})      (reduces dimensionality)
   An asterisk (`*`) can be used instead of {low} or {high} to indicate the minimum/maximum value.
   For a temporal dimension, a single asterisk can be used to indicate the high value.
   Support for `*` is required for time, but optional for spatial and other dimensions.
