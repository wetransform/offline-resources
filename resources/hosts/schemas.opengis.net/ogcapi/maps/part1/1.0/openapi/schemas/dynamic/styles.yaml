# This can be implemented as a dynamic enumeration type
# returning all styles available for the dataset:
$ref: ../../api/styles.json

# Standardizing this capability would enable to generate and compile generic clients
# from OpenAPI definitions which are not tied to a particular implementation.
# There is currently no way in OpenAPI to list styles specific to a particular collection.
# If templated $ref were supported, we could do e.g. $templatedRef: ../../api/styles/{collectionId}
# (see https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-vocabularies/issues/36 and
# https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/2453).
